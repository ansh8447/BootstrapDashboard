# Live Bootstrap Dashboard with Flask Backend 
This is a live analytics dashboard created for a PowerGrid system. The aim of this visualization tool is to display any natural hazards that are going to hit nodes in different regions and predict the affected resiliency score. Additionally, the tool will provide possible proactive actions that can be taken to save the resiliency score from dropping in case of an Avalanche or Tsunami.
